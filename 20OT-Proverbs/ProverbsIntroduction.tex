\section{Interesting}
It is interesting that the word ``the'' is used exactly 1000 time in Proverbs. In the book there are number of words and phrases found 13 times. Given that Proverbs is a ``wisdom'' book, we'd expect that this list would be insightful into wisdom concerning rebellion (consider Table ~\ref{table:13timesinproverbs}).
