The verse speaks to cosmology, or the structure of the universe. See ``garment'' in Hebrews 1:11 - They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment. See the typology pictured by the robe of a vindicated Mordecai in Esther 8:15 - And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. See the pure garment made of a single type of material in Deuteronomy 22:11 - Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together. See the shepherd's garment in Jeremiah 43:12 - And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.  See the Lord's garment (the universe) described in Isaiah 50:9, 51:6, and 51:9.}
