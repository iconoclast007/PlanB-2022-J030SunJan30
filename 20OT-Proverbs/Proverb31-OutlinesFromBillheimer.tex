\textbf{Introduction: }On Motherâ€™s Day we pay tribute to mothers, and rightly so. I think we need to reserve every day for a few minutes of thankfulness and appreciation of motherhood. Women endure a pain in childbirth as a result of the curse of sin and go through the valley of the shadow of death every time they bear a child. Man got off easy on that count; all he has to do is make physical contact with the woman with a seed from his body. Lemuel realized the value of a virtuous woman as he pointed out some facts about such a person, and as I studied this recently, I found a great acrostic outline of the word MOTHER which I want to share. Some time ago, I heard a preacher use this description to compare it with the bride of Christ. It was quite fascinating to see that new light shed on this familiar passage as well.
