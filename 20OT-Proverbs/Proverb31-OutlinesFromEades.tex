\textbf{Introduction: }This chapter is known as "the virtuous woman chapter", and is often attributed to motherhood. King Lemuel's mother was the one feeding him this wise information. The Bible tells us that we should honor our parents all of our lives for good reason. You have heard the saying, "The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world", and we see it no greater than when this king's mother gives him wise instruction about being a leader that honors God.
